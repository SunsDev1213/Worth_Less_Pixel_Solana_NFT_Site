    title: "What are you guys working on?",
    description:
      "A lot of our projects are still fairly quiet. We maintain several budding projects across the ecosystem, but our flagship is otoCiti. otoCiti is meant to be a gateway to the federated metaverse which allows for communication between systems that are currently being built into silos.",

    title: "What do I get from joining the worthless pixels community?",
    description:
      "Our approach to community building is wildly different from many other projects in the blockchain ecosystem. First of all, we don’t utilize many of the chat platforms that NFT projects are deploying today. Why you ask? We don’t want to risk your security. While it is fun to exchange ideas with like minded people, the sheer volume of spam/scams outweighs any potential upside in our eyes. We are actively developing and deploying platforms which both leverage blockchain and emphasize your personal security, many of which are already in beta testing.",

    title: "Does the worthless pixels have any infrastructure?",
    description:
      "Glad you asked! At the moment we use a hybrid model, whereby many of our productions are created using cloud based vm’s with unreasonably large system specifications. The good majority of our mint plans are centered around moving in to our own colocation facility. After a nationwide search, we settled in on the most premier data center in the United States - Switch. Our partnership with switch allows us the freedom to operate on the global switching fabric while keeping costs minimal for our community. We believe implementing our own core network in a data center will provide opportunities for both the worthless pixels and the people who support us like you.",

    title: "How do you guys come up with the prompts?",
    description:
      "We didn’t - you guys did! We scanned numerous twitter spaces, shitposting accounts, social media network to compile a list of the most talked about names and roles. We uploaded them to our database in tables, selected them at random, and concatenated the results. They are completely random, which means you may see some offensive combinations or otherwise unsavory activities. ",

    title: "Did the art take a long time to make?",
    description:
      "Each output on average takes 25 minutes over 250 iterations without including time to mint etc. At 777 outputs, the worthless pixels consumed 777 * 25 minutes for a grand total of 19,425 minutes to produce over a total of 250 iterations for a total of 194,250 to complete the project.",
